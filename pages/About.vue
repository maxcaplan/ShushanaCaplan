            Shushana Caplan is an abstract acrylic artist and art teacher who
            grew up in Montreal, Quebec. She was born in Brest, Belarus in 1940.
            She had a very unusual early childhood. As a one month-old infant,
            she was sent to Siberia with her parents for the duration of the
            second World War. She emigrated to Canada in 1948.

          <p class="text-justify">
            Shushana received her art education at Concordia University in
            Montreal, where she earned degrees in Fine Arts (Studio) and Fine
            Arts Education. She works in mixed media painting, collage and
            abstract acrylics at the present time.

          <p class="text-justify">
            Several years ago Shushana created a series of paintings exploring
            her early experiences as a child refugee in Siberia and the legacy
            of her parents and grandparents in Poland. Using photos that her
            parent had carried with them through their travels across war-torn
            Europe, some over a hundred years old, Shushana created
            “dreamscapes”, paintings that evoked stories about the family's
            journey to freedom. Twenty-five of these works were exhibited at the
            Coral Springs Museum in Florida.

          <p class="text-justify">
            Shushana's work is autobiographical in the sense that it is an
            ongoing narration of her inner thoughts. Personal memories and
            fantasies are explored aesthetically, but the actual process of
            painting is discovery. For her, painting is more than simply
            creating pictures. It is the act of finding meaning.
